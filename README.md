# Sofya: a Theme for Hugo

A minimalist theme for Hugo (static site generator).

**(Add an example URL in here)**

## Motivation

I was unable to find a theme that incompassed all of the design elements that I wanted for my blog, so I created my own. I was, however, inspired by the following designs:

* http://hbpasti.github.io/heather-hugo/
* http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/
* http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/
* http://lessmade.com/themes/less/
* http://www.goldsborough.me/

Some of the base styles have been lifted from: http://hbpasti.github.io/heather-hugo/

## Installation

In order to get started with this theme, create a new hugo site:

  `hugo new site helloworld`

Navigate to the themes directory:

  `cd helloworld/themes`

Download and extract or clone in the theme:

  `git clone https://github.com/jonathondilworth/sofya.git`

Update the theme in the site config.toml file:

  `theme = "sofya"`

Here is an example config.toml file:

  `<<INSERT EXAMPLE FILE HERE>>`
