# Sofya: a Theme for Hugo

A minimalist theme for Hugo (static site generator).

**(Add an example URL in here)**

## Motivation

I was unable to find a theme that incompassed all of the design elements that I wanted for my blog, so I created my own. I was, however, inspired by the following designs:

* http://hbpasti.github.io/heather-hugo/
* http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/
* http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/
* http://lessmade.com/themes/less/
* http://www.goldsborough.me/

Some of the base styles are also from: http://hbpasti.github.io/heather-hugo/

## Installation

## License

## To Do:
* ~~Ensure the template doesnâ€™t break when you remove all the content.~~
* ~~Complete basic footer.~~
* ~~Add social media icons.~~
* ~~Add media queries to ensure the site is responsive.~~
* Ensure that webkit is integrated in, as older browsers will need a web-kit reference for flex box.
* Add documentation.
* Implement MathJax.
* Implement code snippets.
